          <h2>Week 1: reviewing, data visualization, and all sorts of fun stuff</h2><br/><h3>August 24, 2020</h3><br/>
            <br/>
              <p>So, thinking about it now. I could do daily blog posts, but they would for the most part probably look the same. So instead of daily, I'll be doing 2 a week. One at the start of the week and one at the end of the week.<br/><br/>
              Right now I am scheduling 18 hour days for myself. I'm up from 6AM to 12AM. My day is split into 3 parts. I've labeled them JOURNAL WRITING/PLANNING, EXPAND YOUR MIND (EYM), and GET WORK DONE (GWD). EYM is where I do things that aren't necessarily related to mathematics or programming. I do things that will help with like general work-ethic or motivation. This can be whatever. Reading books, watching videos, etc. GWD is where I do everything math and programming related. This is generally split into 2 parts. Studying whatever subject and then working on projects. <br/><br/>
              With that explained, let's actually talk about my goals for the week.<br/><br/>
              <ul>
                <li>Review 1 chapter of a combinatorics textbook</li>
                <li>Review 1 chapter of a Data Structures and Algorithm textbook</li>
                <li>Review 1 chapter of a statistics textbook</li>
                <li>Study data visualization resources such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly</li>
                <li>Continue working on my C++ project (RPG Maker MV clone)</li>
                <li>Try to solve at least 3 leet code problems</li>
                <li>Try to be mindful of distractions, stress and my reaction to it, and sleepiness</li>
              </ul><br/><br/>
              I think I've underplanned this week. That being said, I don't understand my own pacing yet. While getting work done is important, I need to make sure I don't act in such a way that will cause burnout. Let's see how this plays out.

              <p>Hi, I go by the name Tuny. I have a BS in applied mathematics. I'm currently working towards being a data analyst. My favorite languages are C++ and Python. Starting tomorrow I'll be writing blog posts that have 2 parts: morning planning and then night time reflection. Through this blog you'll see how I allot my days to studying and working on projects. Right now, I do not think I am anywhere near calling myself an Applied Mathematician or a Programmer, but I'll try my best to live up to what I believe those titles stand for.
