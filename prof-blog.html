              <p>Hi, I go by the name Tuny. I have a BS in applied mathematics. I'm currently working towards being a data analyst. My favorite languages are C++ and Python. Starting tomorrow I'll be writing blog posts that have 2 parts: morning planning and then night time reflection. Through this blog you'll see how I allot my days to studying and working on projects. Right now, I do not think I am anywhere near calling myself an Applied Mathematician or a Programmer, but I'll try my best to live up to what I believe those titles stand for.
