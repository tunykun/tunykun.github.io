              <p>Since the last time I've posted, I've started learning about modeling and mysql. I've learned basic usage of blender, and am currently taking a introduction to computer graphics class. It's really fun as of now. If I wanted to, I could put up my own server and host my own website. I might do so in the near future, but I'll continue what I'm doing for the time being.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>Anyway, here is a demonstration of the first assignment of my computer graphics class.</p>

              <p>My blog will split in two starting from this post.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I added <a href="masonry.desandro.com">masonry</a> to the 'projects' menu item. The project page is for previewing things that I've created. I wanted to do a slideshow at first, but I think masonry is much better for previewing multiple divs. I'm not completely satisfied with it at the moment, but everything is functional. It won't be noticeable till I have more projects created, so yeah, I look forward to it. I also created an about page using bootstrap. Pretty worthless with this site layout, but it'll definitely be useful for future projects.</p>

              <p>It's been about a month since I've pushed anything to this site. During that time I dove into bootstrap and javascript stuff.</p>
            <br/>
              <p>Playing around with html/css/javascript isn't hard at all, and I basically see it as a programming equivalent to drawing. Time spent as of right now would be thinking about drafting the pages outlines and then writing the code. Definitely doesn't take much time at all.
              <br/><br/>I ended up making a little fun Lux skin randomizer. I actually have a few fun little things that I can translate from Java into wepbages (mainly Lux related things), so I'm kind of looking forward to that.

              <p>Edited the html/css of this site again. Boy, it's definitely full of holes, but you know what, it's fine.</p>
            <br/>
              <p>I need to spend more time writing cleaner code and using better logic because as it currently stands, I kind of want to start over from scratch and use better habits. This is literally just html/css with a bit of js for the menu so I would be fine doing so.</p>

              <p>I am currently messing with putting my code online through github pages. My main problem right now would be the navigation menu. I don't want to keep having to copy and paste the same files over and over for every page. I've been playing with frameset and jquery load as of now. I'd like to have this fixed by the end of the day.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>So far using frameset seems to work. Yes, mobile is a no-no, but accessibility isn't exactly on the top of my list at the moment. I'm actually pretty happy with the results. My only problem might come from formatting. I currently have all my html files in one folder and I'm not satisfied with that at all. Also, my code could use a lot of cleaning.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>While I'm learning, I'm going to be creating tribute pages to things I like. As of right now I'll be starting with Lux from League of Legends, then Alicesoft, and then Yui Asami. I'll be trying to make the format for each character different every time.</p>

              <p>I just completed Persona 5. It wasn't anything groundbreaking, but it took me a whooping 100 hours to finish! Takemi was my partner for my first playthrough, but man, Kawakami, Haru, and Chihaya were pretty cool characters too. I also watched a lot of people play Nier: Automata (such as Pat/Liam from Two Best Friends Play). I can't really talk about it due to spoilers, but yeah it was great.</p>
