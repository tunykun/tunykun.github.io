					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Hello, I go by the name Tuny. I have a Bachelor of Science in mathematics with a focus in applied and computational mathematics. My main interests include computer graphics, Japanese, video games, puzzles, and (that's right) mathematics. The library of video games I've completed could probably be described as 50% RPGs, 30% shooters, 5% rhythm games, 5% visual novels, 2% fighting, and 8% unsorted. To get a sense of my tastes, I'd recommend looking into Bayonetta 1, Catherine, Daibanchou -Big Bang Age-, Dark Souls 1, Persona 4, Touhou 6, and Digimon World 3.</p>
