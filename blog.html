   						<p>I am currently messing with putting my code online through github pages. My main problem right now would be the navigation menu. I don't want to keep having to copy and paste the same files over and over for every page. I've been playing with frameset and jquery load as of now. I'd like to have this fixed by the end of the day.</p>
   						<br/>
   						<p>So far using frameset seems to work. Yes, mobile is a no-no, but accessibility isn't exactly on the top of my list at the moment. I'm actually pretty happy with the results. My only problem might come from formatting. I currently have all my html files in one folder and I'm not satisfied with that at all. Also, my code could use a lot of cleaning.</p>

   						<p>I just completed Persona 5. It wasn't anything groundbreaking, but it took me a whooping 100 hours to finish! Takemi was my partner for my first playthrough, but man, Kawakami, Haru, and Chihaya were pretty cool characters too. I also watched a lot of people play Nier: Automata (such as Pat/Liam from Two Best Friends Play). I can't really talk about it due to spoilers, but yeah it was great.</p>
